# Browser-Based game competition

[#bbg](http://hashbbg.com) is having its third semi-monthly game creation challenge!  A genre will be randomly selected, and, during the next month, contestants will have 12 hours to spend on creating code, art and music for an original game.

All the entries will be open sourced, too, so feel free to have a look at anyone's source code after the fact.  

#### Dates!

The contest starts on 15th Feb, 5pm GMT, and finishes 15th March, 5pm GMT.

#### Genre List:

One of these will be randomly selected! I'll announce which by twitter at the start of the challenge.

* beat-em-up (a la streets of rage)
* FPS
* [rogue-like](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)
* top-down action rpg (a la early zelda)
* tower defense
* racing
* platform
* puzzle
* point & click adventure
* jRPG (a la final fantasy)
* turn-based war strat (a la advance wars)
* RTS
* text-based adventure (predominantly text, other media used for mood)
* dating sim
* sports sim 
* management sim


## Rules

#### Content restriction

* Use only content you have a legal right to.
* PG13 content.  There's no problem with serious topics, but curb the explicit content.

#### Time restriction

You have to do all of the actual coding, music making and art making on the game itself within the 12 hours.  Feel free to do research/conceptual stuff outside that, like:

* Thinking/conceptualising
* Drafting game design
* Looking for tools/art/music

#### Libs/tools

Use any lib or tool you like.  It's all fair game ;)

#### Platform

It has to run in a browser! Feel free to specify *which* browser, but remember; if you're too specific, fewer people may end up playing it.
